# HR Data Analysis Dashboard

## Objective
The objective of this project is to use data-driven insights to help an organization enhance staff performance, increase employee retention, and lower attrition rates.

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing HR data to identify key factors influencing employee attrition. The analysis was conducted using Power BI with data sourced from an Excel spreadsheet.

## Dashboard Features
- **Department-Level Filter:** Allows filtering by departments such as Human Resources, Research & Development, and Sales.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
  - Employee count
  - Attrition figures
  - Attrition rate
  - Average age of employees
  - Average salary of employees
  - Average tenure at the company

## Actions Taken
- **Data Cleaning:** Used Power Query to remove irrelevant data, eliminate duplicates, rename columns, and adjust data types for consistency.
- **Data Processing:** Loaded and applied the cleaned data into Power BI for analysis.
- **Data Visualization:** Created measures and calculated columns using DAX functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `CALCULATE` to generate insights.

## Key Insights
- **Attrition Rate by Education:** The highest attrition rate is found in employees with a Life Sciences education at 38%.
- **Age Group Analysis:** Maximum attrition occurs among employees aged 26-35.
- **Tenure Analysis:** High attrition is observed after one year of employment.
- **Salary Analysis:** Employees earning up to 5K have the highest attrition rate.
- **Job Satisfaction:** Lower job satisfaction is directly related to higher attrition across various job roles.
- **Role-Specific Insights:** The laboratory technician position has the highest attrition rate at 62%.
- **Gender Analysis:** The attrition rate is higher for male employees than female employees.

## Outcome
The insights derived from this analysis enable HR managers to take proactive measures to retain top talent, manage attrition, and create a more productive work environment.
